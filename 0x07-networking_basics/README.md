# Networking Basic

## Concepts
What is the OSI model?
- The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

### [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

### [Different types of network](https://www.lifewire.com/lans-wans-and-other-area-networks-817376)

### [LAN network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network)
- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

- Typical usage
- Typical geographical size

- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is ```localhost```
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

- What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
- What is a port
- Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

### [What is ping /ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_%28networking_utility%29)
- [Positional parameters](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/posparams)


### 1. How is the OSI model organized?
- From the lowest to the highest level

> LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.

### 2. What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
- LAN
### 3. What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
- WAN
### 4. What network do you use when you browse www.holbertonschool.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?
- Internet
### 5. What is a MAC address?
- The unique identifier of a network interface
### 6. What is an IP address?
- Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
> The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol in the Internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, to check if other network devices are available on the network. The command ping uses ICMP to make sure that a network device remains online or to troubleshoot issues on the network.
